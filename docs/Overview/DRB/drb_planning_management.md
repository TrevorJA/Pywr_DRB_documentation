# DRB Planning & Management

The Delaware River Basin is a vital resource for millions of people, along with supporting a broad range of industries and sustaining critical ecosystems. 


## Water Resource Planning & Management

Throughout the 20th century, the Delaware River Basin became increasingly industrialized, urbanized, and populated, leading to growing demands for water resources. In response, various management and planning actions were taken, including the formation of the Delaware River Basin Commission in 1961. This interstate compact agency is responsible for managing the basin’s water resources, including water quality, quantity, and allocation.

### The 1960s Drought and the Delaware River Basin Compact

In the early 1960s, the Delaware River Basin experienced a severe drought that highlighted the need for coordinated management of water resources across state lines. The drought led to significant decreases in water levels in the basin’s reservoirs, threatening water supplies for millions of people in the region.

In response to this crisis the Delaware River Basin Compact was formed in 1961. The compact established the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), consisting of New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York City, as a regulatory agency responsible for managing the basin’s water resources in a coordinated and sustainable manner.

The formation of the DRBC and the Delaware River Basin Compact marked a significant shift in water management in the region. Rather than managing water resources on a state-by-state basis, the DRBC established a framework for coordinated management and decision-making across state lines. This has led to a more integrated approach to water management in the basin, with stakeholders working together to address issues such as water quality, water quantity, and ecosystem health.

One notable example of this coordinated approach is the Flexible Flow Management Program (FFMP), which was established by the DRBC in 2006. The FFMP is a voluntary program that allows water managers to adjust water releases from reservoirs in response to changing environmental and water supply conditions. This flexible approach to water management helps to balance the needs of different stakeholders, including water supply, hydroelectric power generation, recreation, and ecosystem health.
