# Pywr-DRB

Pywr-DRB is an integrated water resource model of the Delaware River Basin (DRB) designed to assist in water resource decision making within the basin.

The model is build using [Pywr](https://pywr.github.io/pywr/index.html), a opensource Python package for constructing resource allocation models.

**NOTE:**

This model, and all of the corresponding documentation are under active development.
