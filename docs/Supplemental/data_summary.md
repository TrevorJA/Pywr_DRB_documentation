# Summary of data

## Model data requirements

The Pywr-DRB model is designed to receive streamflow timeseries at 18 upstream catchments and 3 mainstem locations as inputs.

## Data sources

Four alternative streamflow records are available for simulation, including:
1. Reconstructed historic record
> A combination of historic streamflow observations from USGS gauge stations and predictions of streamflow at ungauged locations. For more detail on ungauged predictions, see Supplemental: Streamflow Prediction in Ungauged Basins. #TODO: Add link

2. National Water Model (NWM)
>The NWM is a hydrologic model.

3. National Hydrologic Model (NHM)
>The NHM is another hydrologic model.

4. Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) Streamflows
>Streamflows throughout the basin are generated within a [WEAP model](https://www.weap21.org/index.asp) model of the basin. These streamflows have been gathered from the model and are available as comparative inputs.
