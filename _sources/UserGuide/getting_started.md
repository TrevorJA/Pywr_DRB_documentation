# Getting Started

Begin by copying or downloading the project repository from GitHub, available [here](https://github.com/ahamilton144/DRB_water_management).

To clone a copy of the repository to your local machine, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/DRB_water_managment
```


## Dependencies

This project requires several dependencies, listed in [`requirements.txt`](), including:

- pywr
- numpy
- pandas
- glob2
- h5py
- matplotlib
- hydroeval
- scipy

You can install all of the necessary dependencies by running:

```
py -m pip install -r <your_local_directory>\DRB_water_management\requirements.txt
```


## executables

`prep_input_data.py`
> This module prepares input-streamflow data files from different potential sources, and saves data in Pywr-ready formats. Sources include observed streamflows, modeled flows from NHMv1.0, NWMv2.1, and WEAP (Aug 23, 2022, version).


`drb_run_sim.py`
> This module is used to execute a simulation of the Pywr-DRB model using a specified streamflow input source, generated by `prep_input_data.py`. The model features (nodes and edges) contained within the `DRB_water_management/model_data/` directory, and are passed to `drb_make_model.py` which constructs a JSON file defining the Pywr model. Once the model is constructed, the simulation is run.

`drb_make_figs.py`
> This module contains several plotting functions. Executing this script after performing a simulation will result in figures being generated and stored in `DRB_water_managment/figs/`.



`drb_run_all.sh`
> This bash script executes each of the three modules above in sequence. Additionally, simulations are run for all available inflow data types.
